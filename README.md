# Upload Action

This is an action that allows you to upload a built SAM application to S3 and ECR using GitHub Actions.

The action packages, signs, and uploads the application to the specified ECR and S3 bucket.

## Usage Example

Pull in the action in your workflow as below, making sure to specify the release version you require.

```yaml
- name: Deploy SAM app to ECR
  uses: alphagov/di-devplatform-upload-action-ecr@<version_number>
  with:
    artifact-bucket-name: ${{ secrets.ARTIFACT_SOURCE_BUCKET_NAME }}
    container-sign-kms-key-arn: ${{ secrets.CONTAINER_SIGN_KMS_KEY }}
    working-directory: ./sam-ecr-app
    template-file: custom-template.yaml
    role-to-assume-arn: ${{ secrets.GH_ACTIONS_ROLE_ARN }}
    ecr-repo-name: ${{ secrets.ECR_REPOSITORY }}
```

## Requirements

- pre-commit:

  ```shell
  brew install pre-commit
  pre-commit install -tpre-commit -tprepare-commit-msg -tcommit-msg
  ```

## Releasing updates

We follow [recommended best practices](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/releasing-and-maintaining-actions) for releasing new versions of the action.

### Non-breaking changes

Release a new minor or patch version as appropriate, then update the base major version release (and any minor versions)
to point to this latest appropriate commit. e.g.: If the latest major release is v2, and you have added a non-breaking
feature, release v2.1.0 and point v2 to the same commit as v2.1.0.

NOTE: Until v3 is released, you will need to point both v1 and v2 to the latest version since there are no breaking changes between them.

### Breaking changes

Release a new major version as normal following semantic versioning.
